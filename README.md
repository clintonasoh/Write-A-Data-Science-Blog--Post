## Data Analysis on FIFA2019 data.

### Requirements

- matplotlib
- sklearn
- pandas
- numpy


### Project motivation
Being a football fan, especially the English Premier League(EPL), exploring FIFA 19 Player Dataset from Kaggle is a great opportunity for me to have a better understanding of the the league, it's players and their wages as well as why some clubs are more successful than others.

### Project files

- `data.csv` :  The dataset file.
- `Data-analysis.ipynb` : IPython Notebook file where the data analysis is done.
- `README.md` : It is this file you are reading, containing the project writeup.

### Summary of the results

- Chelsea had a much older squad, with an average age of 25 years. Whereas the remaining top six teams had squads with an average age of 24 years.
- It is observed that, David Silva with a greater potential than S. AgÃ¼ero is earning lower wages than the latter in Manchester City.
- Ball control, reactions and age are indeed the three main features that decides a player's potential.
